# My Developer Setup with Neovim, Starship, and Packer

Welcome to my developer setup repository! This README will provide you with an in-depth guide to my development environment, featuring Neovim as my text editor, Starship as my shell prompt, and Packer as my Neovim package manager.

## Neovim

[Neovim](https://neovim.io/) is at the core of my development workflow. It's a highly extensible, blazing-fast text editor that I've customized to suit my preferences and boost my productivity. Here's what you need to know:

- **Package Management**: I use [Packer.nvim](https://github.com/wbthomason/packer.nvim) for plugin management. My Neovim setup includes a carefully curated list of plugins that enhance my coding experience. The `init.lua` file in my Neovim configuration contains all the plugin configurations.

- **Keybindings**: I've created custom keybindings for various tasks to streamline my workflow. You'll find these in my `init.lua` file as well.

- **Themes**: I frequently switch between themes to keep my environment visually appealing. My current favorite is [Gruvbox](https://github.com/morhetz/gruvbox).

For a comprehensive look at my Neovim setup, please check out my [dotfiles repository](#link-to-dotfiles) where you can find my Neovim configuration files.

## Starship

[Starship](https://starship.rs/) is the prompt that keeps my shell looking clean, minimal, and informative. Here's what I love about it:

- **Customization**: Starship can be configured to display information such as your current git branch, package versions, time, and more. I've tailored it to include the details that matter most to me, and my configuration can be found in the [Starship.toml](#link-to-starship-config) file in this repository.

- **Speed**: It's incredibly fast, ensuring that my shell prompt doesn't slow me down during development.

- **Cross-Shell Support**: Starship supports a variety of shells, so you can use it with your shell of choice, whether it's Bash, Zsh, or others.
